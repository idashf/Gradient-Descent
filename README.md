# Gradient-Descent
The goal of this assignment is to implement and analyze the Gradient Descent algorithm for estimating the parameters of a linear model using randomly generated samples. Four different experimental steps were designed in order to investigate the effect of various parameters such as the number of samples (K), noise level (a), learning rate, acceptable error (tolerance), and number of iterations on the learning process.
This assignment was implemented in Python using the numpy and matplotlib libraries.
